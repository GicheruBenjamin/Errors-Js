Errors hate them>>> love em They are a crucial part of programming in general.Avoiding pushing that **SHITTY ** code to production.  In js  try-catch, throw error and finally are the way to go in handling errors, This is to create robust and user friendly applications.

## Try-Catch
Ii allows you to test a block of code for errors(try). If an error occurs, the code jumps to the error handler(Catch).
try block: Wrap suspicious code within the try block. If an error is thrown within this block, execution jumps to the catch block.
